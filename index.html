        <p><strong> Preparation </strong></p>
        <ul id="list">
            <li> Preheat oven to 160C </li>
            <li> In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the dry ingredients. Turn mixer on low and allow it to mix for a couple minutes. </li>
            <li> Next combine all of the wet ingredients (except the butter) in a large jug and whisk well. </li>
            <li> Add softened butter into dry ingredients and mix until the batter appears grainy with a sand-like texture to it. Next, add wet ingredients in a slow and steady stream to the bowl until no dry ingredients are visible. Scrape down the bowl and
                mix for another 20 seconds. </li>
            <li> Zest 1 lemon into the mixture and fold in gently. Place about 2 tsp of blueberry into each cupcake liner and scoop the batter on top. Fill about just over ¾ of the way. </li>
            <li> Bake for 20 min or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. </li>
            <li> Allow to cool completely before frosting. </li>
            <li> While cupcakes are baking and cooling prepare your cream cheese frosting by placing a couple drops of purple food gel into your frosting and blueberry jam and whip on high using the paddle attachment for about 30 seconds. </li>
            <li> Frost your cupcakes using a Wilton 6B tip in a swirl. Finish off with a generous amount of lemon zest. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #663399;"> HELPFUL TIPS! </h2>
        <p> STORAGE: store in an airtight container for up to 3 days (refrigerated or unrefrigerated). </p>
        <p> CAKE: Recipe can be used for two 8” cake tin - adjust baking time to 30-40 min and bake on 180C </p>
        <p> EQUIPMENT: Can be made using a hand mixer (always mix on lowest speed) or a hand whisk. Take care not to over mix the batter. </p>
        <p> OVEN TEMPERATURE: If you’re baking at home set your fan forced oven to 160C (320F). </p>
        <p> BAKING TIME: These cupcakes typically bake on a lower temp and for a little longer than regular cupcake recipes. That’s what helps get that gorgeous even dome shape on top. The cupcakes don’t dry out. Bake your cupcakes for 20 min. If you insert
            a skewer and it comes out with wet batter, bake for an extra 5 min until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out with moist crumbs. </p>
